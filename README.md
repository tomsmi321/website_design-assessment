With respect to Jacob Nielson's 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design published in 1994, the design of this site scores high in terms its *aesthetic and minimalist design*. 
Space is used intelligently to ensure the headings and navigation elements are clearly communicated to the user and the relative visibility of each element is high.

<br>
The Alfred Sung website scores low in terms of Jacob Nielson's *consistency and standards* criteria. Fundamental page elements like navigation are not consistently displayed to the user. If a user clicks through a few linked pages then they have no clear way to get back to the home page or to the page they were previously on.
