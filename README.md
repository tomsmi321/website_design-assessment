With respect to Jacob Nielson's 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design published in 1994, the design of this site scores high in terms its aesthetic and minimalist design. 
Space is used intelligently to ensure the headings and navigation elements are clearly communicated to the user and the relative visibility of each element is high.

<br>
The Alfred Sung website scores low in terms of Jacob Nielson's consistency and standards criteria. Fundamental page elements like navigation are not consistently displayed to the user. If a user clicks through a few linked pages then they have no clear way to get back to the home page or to the page they were previously on.
